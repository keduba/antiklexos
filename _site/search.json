    "text": "Value. We believe that each perosn has intrinsic value and this value remains regardless of anything external they may or may not have.\nAngel not ape. Each person is more like a lower angel than a higher ape. No matter how high man is placed on the animal hierarchy, we disagree entirely with the view of a human being as an animal. Man is spirit and flesh.\nEmotions are valid. Every human emotion is valid. No matter how you feel, you can use it as a force for good.\nThe world within Every person bears a world within him. Along with being invaluable, each person alive has an opportunity to contribute around him wherever he may be.\nCourage Courage is the cost and reward of being alive, really alive. The cost of doing great things is courage. And the good news is not only that it is free but also the seed of courage is already inside you.\nHumility is more In all its forms, humility is what enables people to undertake great things. Intellectual, emotional, spiritual humility have been forces for change the world over, since the beginning of time.\nAction We believe that action speaks when words are silent, that each person is an actor in his life, and by exercising our power through positive action we can demand better from ourselves and expect same from others. That is how we raise the standards and quality of life around us."

    "text": "Picture this. you want to start your business, grow your business, learn a new language, get a new job, talk to the cute girl (or boy) you’ve been admiring.\nYou know you could do it. You’ve taken courses, bought the books, read the strategies, subscribed to the experts, in fact you follow them all over the internet. You’ve even tried it a few times. So you know that somehow somehow you can do it.\nYet something is holding you back. Of course you’ve had a few successes. You started and went for a while then stopped so you know that you can do it if you tried harder, or if you were more confident, or if only it hadn’t rained that day…. You get the picture.\nIf only… That’s the thing.\nThe “if only”s …. If only I’d been more confident, if I talked this way, if I dressed like him or sounded like her. A whole lot of if’s.\n“If’s” are so annoying that programmers try to avoid if-statements in their code so that it can run fast. Why then should you be held back by “if’s”?\nTurn if-statements to what-if statements, then conclude by asking “so what”?\n“What if I …, what would happen?”\nThe conditions following an “if only” should not be brakes slowing you down or stopping you. They should be propellers like cannons, shooting you fast to where you want to be. Although we decline all responsibility for how fast you go, we can assure you that you will go fast.\nantiKlexos is how you turn the if-only conditions to what-if statements.\nWhy did I create antiKlexos?\nYou probably know the dire statistics on depression, drug abuse, failed businesses and a host of other calamities. What the statistics often fail to stress enough is the fact that there are human beings behind those numbers and in many of the cases the “failures” were personal, drawn on by what author of the Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows coined as “klexos”, the fixation on the past. Although people look at the past as a way to draw lessons, in many cases it is a rumination in search of closure.\nWhen you’re perambulating without a compass, you can get lost in the woods and time flies fast.\nA good number of problems originate and grow in the human mind, invisible to the outside world and oftimes unknown even to the person involved. When they are unresolved for long periods of time, they degenerate into the problems and issues that the world and the person eventually sees. Friendships broken, businesses lost, depression and other mental health issues.\nThese things stop people in their tracks on the way to progress and achievement, sometimes permanently.\nIf only there was a way to address the real scapegoat behind all the burnout at work, ‘irrational’ spending, ‘falling’ in love with the wrong types, starting the ‘wrong’ businesses and so on, things could get better.\nTo a newly trained carpenter, every problem looks like a nail waiting for a hammer. However, in many cases, the problem is just this, compounded by the current living conditions of the new mode of life to which we are not fully adapted.\nWhat if you knew how to stop replaying old hurtful conversations in your head when they came up as you were preparing for your job interview, what if you don’t have to watch motivational videos all the time to tell you that you have worth, what if you didn’t need to drown your insecurities in a bottle of whisky, or loosen up with wine so you could join in the interesting conversation at table.\nWhat if …?\nTo address this, we designed antiKlexos to be a 3-phase framework to examine, explore and capitalise on the very memories holding you back from becoming the person you always wanted to be. When setting it up, we had in mind a specific kind of person who:\n\nis conscious of a mental block or barrier interfering with your honest efforts to attain a set objective.\nwants to change things for him(her)self.\nhas previously invested in self-improvement and/or self-development but didn’t quite get the expected results.\nsenses that he has a barrier to achievement but is not where the barrier lies.\nis committed to doing the work that is required but only needs a guide, the tools and encouragement.\nand dreads being in the same « position-situation-place » in the next 90-365 days.\n\nIf any of these sounds like you, then you’re in good company.\nWith the antiKlexos framework, you are going to: - identify 3 main thoughts and emotions that trip you off. - recognise their triggers, the telltale signs of their presence, their effects on you. (and learn something about their origins :note: origin doesn’t matter so much) - discover your own unique way to deal with them, turn them to your advantage and do the very things they prevent you from doing - and as a bonus, you will add new areas to conquer.\nIf you have made it this far, then you are definitely kindred spirit.\nWe promise that if you have ever bought a program (online or offline) that you didn’t finish, you will go back and complete it if it aligns with your needs. And if you buy a course or training after this one, you will very likely complete it because you made the choice to learn something you want to use. What is more, you’re going to get more out of it than even the creator intended.^1\nThat is the antiKlexos promise.\nP.S. antiKlexos is based on first principles around the workings of the mind drawn from philosophy, psychology, medicine, neuroscience and earth science (yes indeed).\nThe 3 fold goal is that 1. The pains of the memories become commonplace and ordinary like breathing, or talking a walk, and your mind no longer to stops at them or stops you because of them. 2. You use them as pointers to things you can excel at and become exceptional at. 3. You squeeze the juice out of all the memories to the point where they become things you are extremely grateful for.\n^1: Unless the course/training/program was not well done, in which case we encourage you to set it aside without regrets."
